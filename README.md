## Project Overview

Building a comprehensive, offline-first field data collection and analysis suite for:
- ✅ Vegetation plot surveys
- ✅ Species-area curve analysis
- ✅ Biodiversity indices calculation
- ✅ Export & reporting tools
- ✅ (Planned) Bird surveys, GIS, water quality, soil sampling

**Vision:** Eliminate paper forms, reduce data entry time, generate instant biodiversity insights in the field.

## Current Phase: Development Active 🚀

### What We've Accomplished
**✅ Complete discovery** - 28 questions + follow-ups  
**✅ Architecture finalized** - React + PWA + TypeScript  
**✅ MVP scope approved** - Including canopy photo analysis  
**✅ Tech stack locked** - Ready for development  

### Current Status
**🚀 STARTING:** React project setup now
**📅 Timeline:** 5-6 days to deployed MVP
**🎯 Scope:** Vegetation plots + Biodiversity + Canopy photos

**See:** `05-FINAL-MVP-SCOPE.md` for details.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (4-7 days)
**Priority Modules:**
1. **Vegetation Plotting Tool** - Digital quadrat surveys
2. **Species-Area Curve Tool** - Nested plot analysis
3. **Biodiversity Analytics Engine** - Shannon, Simpson, etc.
4. **Field Data Export & Sync** - CSV/Excel/JSON

### Phase 2: V1 (2-4 weeks)
- Bird Survey Tool (PBA Protocol)
- GIS Integration
- Photo Documentation & Species ID
- Canopy Cover Measurement

### Phase 3: Advanced (3-6 months)
- Water Quality Monitoring
- Soil Sampling
- Carbon Sequestration Calculator
- Report Generation

## Key Decisions Pending

| Decision | Depends On |
|----------|-----------|
| React vs Vanilla JS | Technical proficiency, timeline |
| Offline-first architecture | Field connectivity |
| Mobile vs Desktop priority | Primary device usage |
| Cloud backend vs local-only | Collaboration needs |
| Deployment platform | Hosting preferences |

*All decisions will be documented in `00-ARCHITECTURE-DRAFT.md`*

## Tech Stack (Preliminary)

### Concept A: PWA Suite
**React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, IndexedDB, Service Workers**

**Use when:** Long-term project, professional scale, app-like UX

### Concept B: Vanilla Suite
**HTML/CSS/JS, IndexedDB, Chart.js, GitHub Pages**

**Use when:** Rapid MVP, learning project, simplicity priority

### Concept C: Hybrid
**Start Vanilla → Migrate to React**

**Use when:** Fast start with upgrade path
