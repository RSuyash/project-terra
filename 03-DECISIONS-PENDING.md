## 🔴 CRITICAL: MVP Scope Approval

**Choose ONE:**

### Option A: Full MVP (Recommended)
- Complete vegetation plotting
- Species-area curve (fixed sizes)
- 4 core biodiversity indices
- CSV export
- Mobile-responsive PWA
- **Timeline:** 3-4 days
- **Approx. 40-60 hours of dev work**

**✅ Appears on:**
- Vercel URL
- Works offline
- Ready for real field use
- Needs iteration post-launch

### Option B: Ultra-Minimal MVP
- Basic plot entry only
- CSV export
- No analytics yet
- **Timeline:** 1-2 days
- **Approx. 15-20 hours of dev work**

**❌ Only in:**
- Basic functionality
- Requires immediate follow-up build
- May not solve immediate needs
